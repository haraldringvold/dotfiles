Dotfiles
========

My dotfiles setup. It configures the shell and vim among others.
Maybe you will find something of worth here? 🔍

[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) is used for quickly setting up
the relevant file where needed. It can also run abitrary commands as part of
installation. I use this for things like cloning a private repo with local configurations for
different contexts (mac, linux, work, etc.) and installing [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

The structure of this repo is based on Dotbots creators 
[private dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles), especially the
local override setup.

The vim/nvim setup is inspired by 
[ChristianChiarulli/nvim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim) where I
discovered a lot of new neat plugins. 🙌
